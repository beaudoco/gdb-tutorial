What is Git?
-Version Ctrl
-Super useful for working w/ multiple engineers & tracking changes when code goes bad

There are 4 main Stages of Git: Working directory, staging area, local repo, & git remote repo
-The working dir, staging area, & local repo are all stored on the local computer
-The git remote repo is stored on github/gitlab/bitbucket etc
-The working directory is the location of a current project. When we want git to start tracking this location we 
use "git add ." to include these files for tracking via git. When we want get to create a check point where we can
go back to this exact point we do "git commit -m". This attaches all the changes that have been made at this time
to a specific version ID. When we want this published we then do a "git push" where it is now accessible to the
cloud.
